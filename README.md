# üß† Assembly Language Quiz System

A console-based, interactive **multiple-choice quiz system** developed in **Assembly Language**, designed to enhance learning and assessment in academic or training environments. The system provides instant feedback, tracks incorrect attempts, and ends the game after three wrong answers.

---

## üìÑ Abstract

This project presents an **Assembly Language-based Quiz System** designed to streamline the process of administering and taking quizzes.
Players can answer multiple-choice questions with immediate feedback. A player is allowed **only two incorrect answers**; the third wrong attempt results in failure.
The system offers a simple yet effective platform for educational engagement using low-level programming concepts.

## üìñ Introduction

This quiz game allows a user to choose a subject and answer a set of questions. The system evaluates each answer:

* Displays ‚ÄúYour answer is right‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour answer is wrong‚Äù.
* Ends the game on the **third wrong attempt**.
* If completed successfully, displays a congratulatory message.

This system promotes interactive learning and assessment with immediate feedback.
